# RUCourseSniping
A very simple course sniper for Rutgers courses


# simpleSniper.py
Requests a Rutgers API endpoint of open sections, the script simply checks whether it's in there. If it is, then it will print to the screen, if it's not, then it will wait the delay time, then check again.

# notifSniper.py
Works similarly to simpleSniper.py, however, this one hides in the background of your computer, also takes in multiple inputs, and alerts you via the Windows notification system once a course is open.
